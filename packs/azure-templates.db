The allip gains a primary incorporeal touch attack if it has no other natural attacks.</p>\n<p>The allip&rsquo;s natural attacks no longer deal normal damage. Instead, each attack deals Wisdom damage due to its Touch of Insanity ability (see below).</p>\n<p><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> The allip loses all special attacks that require corporeal contact, but gains those described here. A dread allip cannot cast spells that require material components unless it has the Eschew Materials feat.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Babble (Su):</em> An allip constantly mutters and whines to itself, creating a hypnotic effect. All sane creatures within 60 feet of the dread allip must succeed on a Will save or be affected as though by a hypnotism spell for 2d4 rounds. Any creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the same dread allip&rsquo;s babble for 24 hours.<br />When the allip casts a spell with a verbal component, its babble special attack is negated during casting, and any creature already hypnotized by it is freed of the effect. This is a sonic, mind- affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</li>\n<li><em>Touch of Insanity (Su):</em> Each of an allip&rsquo;s incorporeal touch attacks deals 1d6 points of Wisdom damage (Will save negates). A successful critical hit causes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage and 1 points of Wisdom drain (instead of double Wisdom damage). A dread allip gains 5 temporary hit points for each successful attack with Touch of Insanity. The save DC is Charisma-based.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Abilities:</strong> Dex +2, Cha +6.

A dread ghost uses all the base creature&rsquo;s statistics and special abilities, except as noted here.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge Rating:</strong> Same as base creature +3.</p>\n<p><strong>Type:</strong> The creature&rsquo;s type changes to undead and gains the incorporeal subtype. Do not recalculate base attack bonuses, saves, or skill points.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Any.</p>\n<p><strong>Senses:</strong> A dread ghost gains darkvision +60 ft.</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Class:</strong> A dread ghost gains a deflection bonus equal to its Charisma modifier (minimum +1). It loses the base creature&rsquo;s natural armor bonus, as well as all armor and shield bonuses that are not force effects or ghost touch items.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> Change all of the base creature&rsquo;s racial HD to d8s.</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Abilities: </strong>A dread ghost retains all of the defensive abilities of the base creature save those that rely on a corporeal form to function. Dread ghosts gain channel resistance +8, spell resistance equal to 10 + dread ghost&rsquo;s total Hit Dice, the incorporeal ability, and all of the immunities granted by its undead traits. Dread ghosts also gain the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Improved Rejuvenation (Su):</em> In most cases, it&rsquo;s difficult to destroy a dread ghost through simple combat: the &ldquo;destroyed&rdquo; spirit restores itself in 1d4 hours. Even the most powerful spells are usually only temporary solutions. The only way to permanently destroy a dread ghost is to determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in peace. The exact means varies with each spirit and may require a good deal of research, and should be created specifically for each different ghost by the GM.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> A dread ghost gains a fly speed equal to double the base creature&rsquo;s highest speed, with perfect maneuverability. If the base creature can already fly, its maneuverability becomes perfect and its fly speed increases to double the base creature&rsquo;s highest speed.</p>\n<p><strong>Attacks:</strong> A dread ghost loses all of the base creature&rsquo;s attacks. If it could wield weapons in life, it can wield ghost touch weapons as a dread ghost.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> A dread ghost retains all the special attacks of the base creature, but any relying on physical contact do not function. In addition, a dread ghost gains one dread ghost special attack from the list below for every 3 points of CR (minimum 1&mdash;the first ability chosen must always be corrupting touch). The save DC against a dread ghost&rsquo;s special attack is Charisma-based unless otherwise noted. Additional dread ghost abilities beyond these (including those for the standard ghost) can be designed at the GM&rsquo;s discretion.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Aligned Attacks (Su):</em> The dread ghost had strong- aligned convictions when it was alive. All the dread ghost&rsquo;s attacks are considered magic and aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. The alignment matches one component (dread ghost&rsquo;s choice at the time of creation) of its own alignment (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful). The dread ghost gains the appropriate alignment subtype of this choice. In addition, all of its attacks deal +1d6 points of extra damage per 2 HD (max 10d6) to creatures of the opposing alignment. This ability can be taken multiple times, once for each component of the dread ghost&rsquo;s alignment.</li>\n<li><em>Chilling Aura (Su): </em>The dread ghost died either in the cold or was emotionally distant in life. When a dread ghost manifests, it emits a deadly chill in a 20-foot radius around itself, on both the Material and the Ethereal Planes. Each creature within this area takes 3d6 points of cold damage per round. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage. The dread ghost is not affected by its own chilling aura, and it is immune to that of other dread ghosts.</li>\n<li><em>Corrupting Gaze (Su):</em> The dread ghost is disfigured through age or violence and has a gaze attack with a range of 60 feet that causes 4d10 damage and 1d6 Charisma damage (Fortitude save negates Charisma damage but not physical damage).</li>\n<li><em>Corrupting Touch (Su):</em> All dread ghosts gain this incorporeal touch attack. By passing part of its incorporeal body through a foe&rsquo;s body as a standard action, the dread ghost inflicts a number of d8s equal to its CR in damage. This damage is not negative energy&mdash;it manifests in the form of physical wounds and aches from supernatural aging. Creatures immune to magical aging are immune to this damage, but otherwise the damage bypasses all forms of damage reduction. A Fortitude save halves the damage inflicted.</li>\n<li><em>Death Wail (Su):</em> The dread ghost died in psychological torment. Once every 1d4 rounds, the dread ghost can let loose a terrible wail as a full-round action, targeting it against one creature within 100 feet of it. If the target creature can hear the death wail, it must succeed on a Fortitude save or be reduced to &ndash;1 hp and is dying. Any other creature within 100 feet that can hear the wail must succeed on a Fortitude save at the same DC or gain 1 negative level. A creature that succeeds on the save cannot be affected by that dread ghost&rsquo;s death wail for 24 hours. The death wail is a sonic death effect.</li>\n<li><em>Draining Touch (Su):</em> The dread ghost died while insane or diseased. It gains a single touch attack that drains 1d2 points from any two different ability scores it selects on a hit. A successful Fortitude save turns the drain into ability damage. On each such successful attack, the ghost heals 5 points of damage to itself. When a dread ghost makes a draining touch attack, it cannot use its standard corrupting touch attack.</li>\n<li><em>Frightful Moan (Su):</em> The dread ghost died in the throes of crippling terror. It can emit a frightful moan as a standard action. All living creatures within a 30-foot spread must succeed on a Will save or become panicked for 4d4 rounds. A creature that successfully saves against the moan cannot be affected by the same ghost&rsquo;s moan for 24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect.</li>\n<li><em>Horrific Appearance (Su):</em> The dread ghost died extremely violently or was mutilated. Any living creature within 60 feet that views a dread ghost must succeed on a Fortitude save or immediately take 1d4 points of Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution damage (roll each separately). A creature that successfully saves against this effect cannot be affected by the same dread ghost&rsquo;s horrific appearance for 24 hours. This is a gaze effect.</li>\n<li><em>Invisibility (Sp):</em> The dread ghost can use greater invisibility (as the spell) at will.</li>\n<li><em>Malevolence (Su):</em> The ghost&rsquo;s jealousy of the living is particularly potent. Once per round, the ghost can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 15th or the ghost&rsquo;s Hit Dice, whichever is higher), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the ghost must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the attack with a successful Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same ghost&rsquo;s malevolence for 24 hours.</li>\n<li><em>Power over Undead (Su):</em> The dread ghost was a leader of renown or died while leading others. The dread ghost can enslave other undead within 30 feet (as the Command Undead feat, using the dread ghost&rsquo;s total HD for the DC). The dread ghost can use this ability 3 + its Cha modifier (min 0) times per day.</li>\n<li><em>Shattering Presence (Su): </em>The dread ghost died by bludgeoning or in a great fall. As a full-round action the dread ghost can release a bust of pure force that deals 6d6 damage to all nonmagical objects within a 30-foot burst. Any object weighing more than 5 pounds per character level the dread ghost possesses is not affected. A magic item must succeed on a Fortitude save or take the above damage. Constructs, crystalline, or otherwise fragile creatures within the area take 1d6 points of damage per 3 HD the dread ghost possesses (to a maximum of 6d6). A successful Reflex save halves this damage. The burst of force does not affect undead or living creatures. Objects destroyed or creatures killed by this effect shatter and burst in a 5-foot-radius burst of shards. Every creature within range of a shattering object must succeed on a DC 20 Reflex save or take 1d6 points of slashing damage. A creature wearing or carrying an object when it shatters takes 2d6 points of slashing damage (no save). This is a force effect.</li>\n<li><em>Telekinesis (Sp):</em> The ghost&rsquo;s death involved great physical trauma. The ghost can use telekinesis (as the spell) as a standard action at will (caster level 12th or equal to the ghost&rsquo;s HD, whichever is higher).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Abilities:</strong> Cha +8; as an incorporeal undead creature, a dread ghost has no Strength or Constitution score.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Dread ghosts have a +8 racial bonus on Perception and Stealth skill checks. A dread ghost has Climb, Disguise, Fly, Intimidate, Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (religion), Perception, Sense Motive, Spellcraft, and Stealth as class skills in addition to the class skills of the base creature.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":""},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"0","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":""},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":[],"attackNotes":[],"soundEffect":"","changes":[{"_id":"boh1m3ow","formula":"8","operator":"add","subTarget":"cha","modifier":"racial","priority":0,"value":0},{"_id":"4r1uc7ue","formula":"8","operator":"add","subTarget":"skill.per","modifier":"racial","priority":0,"value":0},{"_id":"3l5y7emd","formula":"8","operator":"add","subTarget":"skill.ste","modifier":"racial","priority":0,"value":0}],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"scriptCalls":[],"featType":"template","associations":{"classes":[]},"showInQuickbar":false,"nonlethal":false,"abilityType":"none","crOffset":"3","disabled":false},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"y80nzxfncE91hA02":3,"WMadxIpIUgu0uAvn":3,"DH9noPYZRP1zLvEM":3,"wpj1hKUgB5eM1zCQ":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf1.monster-templates.Ovo97rjBymtgkjdH"}},"_id":"0QrLc4GBQycJt7sX"}

As undead, blood knights use their Charisma modifier to determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution).</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Class:</strong> A blood knight gains an armor bonus to Armor Class based on the kind armor it wears (usually full plate; AC bonus +9). If the base creature has a natural armor bonus, it loses it and gains a deflection bonus equal to 1 + the base creature&rsquo;s original natural armor bonus.</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Abilities:</strong> A blood knight gains all the defensive abilities and immunities of the undead type plus fast healing 10, and DR 10/bludgeoning. If the base creature already has DR greater than 10, use the higher value.

All of a blood knight&rsquo;s piercing or slashing attacks, both natural and manufactured, gain the bleed (2 hp/round) universal monster ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> A blood knight retains all the base creature&rsquo;s special attacks and gains those described here. All DCs are Charisma-based unless otherwise specified:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Blood Drain (Ex):</em> Any living creature damaged by a blood knight&rsquo;s natural attack takes 1 point of Constitution damage in addition to the normal damage. This Constitution damage is subject to the multiplier for a critical hit, just as normal damage would be. In a grapple, a blood knight deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage to a living foe each round that the grapple is maintained. For each point of Constitution damage caused, the blood knight gains 5 temporary hit points.</li>\n<li><em>Blood Slick (Ex): </em>A blood knight constantly drips slippery blood in a 10-foot-radius spread around itself. Entering the area of a blood slick counts as difficult terrain and as it if were under the effects of a grease spell. The DC on the Reflex save to avoid falling is Charisma-based. Blood knights are immune to the slipperiness of any blood knight&rsquo;s blood slick.</li>\n<li><em>Fountain of Blood (Ex):</em> Once every 1d4 rounds, as a full-round action, a blood knight can spray blood from its armor in a great cascade. Each creature within a 15-foot radius is covered in blood and must succeed on a Fortitude save as though it had ingested the blood knight&rsquo;s poisonous blood. The blood fills the area until the blood knight&rsquo;s next turn. Creatures entering the spray while it persists are subject to its effects, but a creature can be affected only once per round.<br />The area covered by the blood spray becomes coated as though by a blood slick and remains slippery for 1 round per two Hit Dice the blood knight possesses. The blood remains until it is washed away with at least 5 gallons of water or other liquid, or burned away with normal or magical fire as a full-round action. Creatures and objects within the area that do not have total cover are coated with the blood, and a creature wishing to use, pick up, or cling to an item coated in the blood must succeed on a Reflex save (save DC is Charisma-based) to do so. Failure mean the item is immediately dropped. A creature coated in blood gains a +10 bonus on Escape Artist checks.<br />Blood knights are immune to the slipperiness of any blood knight&rsquo;s fountain of blood.</li>\n<li><em>Poison Blood (Ex):</em> Any opponent that strikes a blood knight with a bite attack is subject to this attack, as is any creature in the area of the fountain of blood attack.<br /><em>Poison Blood</em>&mdash;ingested;<em> save</em> Fortitude; <em>onset</em> 1 minute; <em>frequency</em> 1/minute for 6 minutes; <em>effect</em> 1 Con plus nauseated; <em>cure</em> 1 save.

It can retrieve any item stored in its body as a move action or as a free action that is part of a move. An item to be stored must be of a size and shape that fits within whatever portion of the blood knight&rsquo;s armor it is placed. For example, an orc blood knight could store potion vials, crossbow quarrels, or daggers in its arm, but it could not store a longsword there. A stored item&rsquo;s weight counts towards a blood knight&rsquo;s encumbrance.</li>\n<li><em>Bonded Armor (Ex):</em> A blood knight always wears the suit of armor in which it died. It cannot remove this armor or exchange it for another suit. If the armor is destroyed, the blood knight is destroyed as well. The blood knight has a +5 bonus on saving throws made on behalf of its armor.</li>\n<li>Creatures killed by Constitution damage from a blood knight&rsquo;s attacks rise as blood knights or blood gaunts in 1d4 rounds, depending on whether or not it was wearing heavy armor.</li>\n</ul>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":""},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"0","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":""},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":[],"attackNotes":[],"soundEffect":"","changes":[{"_id":"yrz0tj1r","formula":"6","operator":"add","subTarget":"str","modifier":"racial","priority":0,"value":0},{"_id":"y43emd8m","formula":"4","operator":"add","subTarget":"dex","modifier":"racial","priority":0,"value":0},{"_id":"pbg29iw5","formula":"6","operator":"add","subTarget":"cha","modifier":"racial","priority":0,"value":0},{"_id":"nqkbit8y","formula":"10","operator":"add","subTarget":"skill.esc","modifier":"racial","priority":0,"value":0}],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"scriptCalls":[],"featType":"template","associations":{"classes":[]},"showInQuickbar":false,"nonlethal":false,"abilityType":"none","crOffset":"2","disabled":false},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"y80nzxfncE91hA02":3,"WMadxIpIUgu0uAvn":3,"DH9noPYZRP1zLvEM":3,"wpj1hKUgB5eM1zCQ":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf1.monster-templates.Ovo97rjBymtgkjdH"}},"_id":"4AWftL4Tt2YQuWZQ"}

A demon-possessed creature subjected to a dispel chaos or dispel evil spell must succeed on a Will saving throw or lose all the modifications bestowed by the demon-possessed creature template for a number of rounds equal to the opponent&rsquo;s caster level. The demon is immediately ejected from the possessed creature&rsquo;s body and appears in the nearest open square.</li>\n<li>A demon-possessed creature subjected to a banishment spell must succeed on a Will saving throw or lose the template until again possessed by a demon. Failure returns the demon to its home plane, as noted in the spell description.</li>\n<li>An antimagic field or any antimagic effect suppresses all the effects of the demon-possessed creature template. It also prevents the demon from communicating with the possessed creature, using its perceptions, and exiting its body (unless it dies) for as long as the demon-possessed creature remains in the antimagic area.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Special Attacks: </strong>If the possessing demon has the summon ability, the demon-possessed creature gains the demon&rsquo;s universal summon monster ability as well, albeit with the percent of success one-half of the possessing demon&rsquo;s and only usable once a day.</p>\n<p>Additionally, a demon-possessed creature gains one of the possessing demon&rsquo;s supernatural attacks or special quality that does not otherwise directly depend on another of the demon&rsquo;s special abilities (once chosen this cannot be changed). The chosen ability is usable once per day and all numeric factors (range, damage, etc.) except for saves are halved. If an ability depends on a specific type of natural attack, the demon-possessed creature gains that attack but it only deals the effect of the ability once a day. If the ability is a permanent defense or aura for the possessing demon (such as a babau&rsquo;s protective slime), the possessed creature can activate and dismiss it at will, but it still can only be used once a day. Effects that automatically occur given certain conditions, like a balor-possessed&rsquo;s death throes, are unchanged except for numeric factors being halved.

For example, a coloxus-possessed creature does +3d6 damage to good creatures. All of a demon-possessed creature&rsquo;s natural and manufactured weapons are treated as magic, chaotic, and evil-aligned for overcoming damage reduction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Spell-Like Abilities:</strong> The creature gains the following spell-like abilities, depending on the kind of demon possessing it. The creature uses its Hit Dice or caster level, whichever is higher, as the caster level for its spell-like abilities. Save DCs are based on the creature&rsquo;s Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, whichever is highest.</p>\n<p><strong>Abilities:</strong> A demon-possessed creature&rsquo;s ability scores change from the base creature according to the kind of demon possessing it as given on Table 2-15.</p>\n<p><strong>Languages:</strong> If a demon-possessed creature can speak, it gains the Abyssal as a bonus language.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Qualities:</strong> A demon-possessed creature gains the following.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Possessed (Su):</em> Each demon-possessed creature is inhabited by a specific demon. The demon can neither control the possessed creature nor read its mind, and it perceives only what the possessed creature does.</li>\n<li>The demon is in constant telepathic communication with the possessed creature, imparting its thoughts and desires, regardless of language. To gain the possessed creature&rsquo;s cooperation, the demon usually offers telepathic suggestions that it thinks a chaotic evil creature might find appealing.</li>\n<li>While possessing another creature, the demon does not have access to any of its supernatural, spell-like, or extraordinary abilities, and cannot cast spells or take any mental actions beyond thinking and using Intelligence-based skills (except those mentioned by the template). It cannot be targeted by any spell or effect (except as described under spell vulnerability), but it can be detected normally by divination spells.</li>\n<li>Damage that harms the possessed creature does not harm the possessing demon. If the possessed creature dies, the demon returns to its plane of origin unharmed.</li>\n<li>The demon can enter and exit the possessed creature at any time as a standard action. When it does so, it appears in the nearest available open space.

A DC Fortitude save reduces this damage to 3d6 + 1 point per caster level points damage. The soul of a creature slain by this attack becomes trapped within the dread devourer&rsquo;s chest.<br />The creature cannot be brought back to life until the dread devourer&rsquo;s destruction (or a spell deflection&mdash; see above) releases its soul. A dread devourer can hold a single soul at a time. A trapped soul provides a dread devourer with 5 essence points for each Hit Die possessed by the soul. A devourer mmust expend essence points when it uses a spell-like ability equal to the spell&rsquo;s level (spell levels for its spell- like abilities are included as a superscript).<br />At the start of an encounter, a devourer usually has one soul and 3d4+3 essence points available.

All DCs are Charisma-based unless otherwise specified:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Blood Drain (Ex):</em> Any living creature damaged by a blood knight&rsquo;s natural attack takes 1 point of Constitution damage in addition to the normal damage. This Constitution damage is subject to the multiplier for a critical hit, just as normal damage would be. In a grapple, a blood knight deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage to a living foe each round that the grapple is maintained. For each point of Constitution damage caused, the blood knight gains 5 temporary hit points.</li>\n<li><em>Blood Slick (Ex): </em>A blood knight constantly drips slippery blood in a 10-foot-radius spread around itself. Entering the area of a blood slick counts as difficult terrain and as it if were under the effects of a grease spell. The DC on the Reflex save to avoid falling is Charisma-based. Blood knights are immune to the slipperiness of any blood knight&rsquo;s blood slick.</li>\n<li><em>Fountain of Blood (Ex):</em> Once every 1d4 rounds, as a full-round action, a blood knight can spray blood from its armor in a great cascade. Each creature within a 15-foot radius is covered in blood and must succeed on a Fortitude save as though it had ingested the blood knight&rsquo;s poisonous blood. The blood fills the area until the blood knight&rsquo;s next turn. Creatures entering the spray while it persists are subject to its effects, but a creature can be affected only once per round.<br />The area covered by the blood spray becomes coated as though by a blood slick and remains slippery for 1 round per two Hit Dice the blood knight possesses. The blood remains until it is washed away with at least 5 gallons of water or other liquid, or burned away with normal or magical fire as a full-round action. Creatures and objects within the area that do not have total cover are coated with the blood, and a creature wishing to use, pick up, or cling to an item coated in the blood must succeed on a Reflex save (save DC is Charisma-based) to do so. Failure mean the item is immediately dropped. A creature coated in blood gains a +10 bonus on Escape Artist checks.<br />Blood knights are immune to the slipperiness of any blood knight&rsquo;s fountain of blood.</li>\n<li><em>Poison Blood (Ex):</em> Any opponent that strikes a blood knight with a bite attack is subject to this attack, as is any creature in the area of the fountain of blood attack.<br /><em>Poison Blood</em>&mdash;ingested;<em> save</em> Fortitude; <em>onset</em> 1 minute; <em>frequency</em> 1/minute for 6 minutes; <em>effect</em> 1 Con plus nauseated; <em>cure</em> 1 save.

It can retrieve any item stored in its body as a move action or as a free action that is part of a move. An item to be stored must be of a size and shape that fits within whatever portion of the blood knight&rsquo;s armor it is placed. For example, an orc blood knight could store potion vials, crossbow quarrels, or daggers in its arm, but it could not store a longsword there. A stored item&rsquo;s weight counts towards a blood knight&rsquo;s encumbrance.</li>\n<li><em>Bonded Armor (Ex):</em> A blood knight always wears the suit of armor in which it died. It cannot remove this armor or exchange it for another suit. If the armor is destroyed, the blood knight is destroyed as well. The blood knight has a +5 bonus on saving throws made on behalf of its armor.</li>\n<li>Creatures killed by Constitution damage from a blood knight&rsquo;s attacks rise as blood knights or blood gaunts in 1d4 rounds, depending on whether or not it was wearing heavy armor.</li>\n</ul>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":""},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"0","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":""},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":[],"attackNotes":[],"soundEffect":"","changes":[{"_id":"yrz0tj1r","formula":"6","operator":"add","subTarget":"str","modifier":"racial","priority":0,"value":0},{"_id":"y43emd8m","formula":"4","operator":"add","subTarget":"dex","modifier":"racial","priority":0,"value":0},{"_id":"pbg29iw5","formula":"6","operator":"add","subTarget":"cha","modifier":"racial","priority":0,"value":0},{"_id":"nqkbit8y","formula":"10","operator":"add","subTarget":"skill.esc","modifier":"racial","priority":0,"value":0}],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"scriptCalls":[],"featType":"template","associations":{"classes":[]},"showInQuickbar":false,"nonlethal":false,"abilityType":"none","crOffset":"2","disabled":false},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"y80nzxfncE91hA02":3,"WMadxIpIUgu0uAvn":3,"DH9noPYZRP1zLvEM":3,"wpj1hKUgB5eM1zCQ":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf1.monster-templates.Ovo97rjBymtgkjdH"}},"_id":"PoNQJtSWtC3iFDOo"}

They are </em><em>usually found in particularly cold areas of the Elemental </em><em>Planes of Water and Air. On the Material Plane, they can </em><em>be found on the highest peaks of mountains, and in the </em><em>boreal expanses of the poles, they can be found dancing </em><em>in the frigid wind and blizzards.</em></h4>\n<h4><em>A cold creature appears as a squall of sleet and snow in </em><em>the shape of the base creature.</em></h4>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Creating a Cold Creature</strong></span></h4>\n<p>&ldquo;Cold&rdquo; is an inherited template that can be applied to any creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A cold creature uses all the base creature&rsquo;s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge Rating:</strong> Same as base creature +2.</p>\n<p><strong>Type:</strong> The cold creature&rsquo;s type changes to outsider and gains the cold, elemental, extraplanar, and incorporeal subtypes. If the base creature has the fire subtype, it loses it. Recalculate base attack bonuses, saves, or skill points.</p>\n<p><strong>Aura:</strong> A cold creature gains the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Cold Aura (Su): </em>A cold creature emits supernatural cold in a 10-foot radius around it. All those within the area of effect take +1d6 cold damage plus an additional +1d6 cold damage for every 5 racial HD the base creature has. A cold creature cannot suppress this ability.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> Change all of the base creature&rsquo;s racial HD to d10s.</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Fortitude and Reflex are good saves for cold creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Abilities:</strong> A cold creature gains immunity to cold and the incorporeal ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> A cold creature gains fire vulnerability.</p>\n<p><strong>Attacks:</strong> If the base creature does not have a natural attack, it gains a single slam attack. This attack does damage based on the creature&rsquo;s size, plus cold damage due to its freezing blows ability. Even though it is incorporeal, a cold creature&rsquo;s blows are made of biting winds and slashing ice. However, a cold creature cannot use manufactured weapons.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Attacks: </strong>A cold creature gains the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Cold Spellcasting (Su):</em> A cold creature casts all spells and spell-like abilities with the cold descriptor at one caster level higher. A cold creature can add the cold descriptor to any damaging spell. Such spells are not cast at increased caster level and half of the damage dealt is cold damage. A cold creature cannot cast spells or use spell-like abilities with the fire descriptor.</li>\n<li><em>Freezing Blows (Ex):</em> A cold creature&rsquo;s attacks deal extra cold damage based on its size as a slam attack of a creature one size category larger. If the creature struck has the water subtype, the damage increases one additional step. This damage stacks with any other cold damage the cold creature does.</li>\n<li><em>Freezing Embrace (Su):</em> Once per day plus one additional time per day per every 5 racial Hit Dice the base creature has, a cold creature can attempt to freeze opponents solid by moving over them. The area of this effect is equal to the cold creature&rsquo;s space. Creatures that fail a Fortitude save are turned to solid ice. Creatures that are larger than the cold creature&rsquo;s space cannot be frozen solid, but take 1d6 cold damage multiplied by the cold creature&rsquo;s total Hit Dice (minimum 1d6, maximum 20d6). The Fortitude save halves this damage. This ability is otherwise identical the flesh to stone spell. The save DC is Charisma-based. A frozen creature can be returned to normal by a stone to flesh spell or equivalent magic. If a frozen creature dies, it melts.</li>\n<li><em>Freezing Touch (Ex):</em> If the cold creature touches a body of liquid that is not a water-based creature, such as a water elemental, it freezes the liquid to a depth of 1 inch in a 10-foot radius. Each additional round the cold creature is in contact with the liquid or ice, the ice field increases its depth by 1 inch and 10 feet in radius. The ice field&rsquo;s maximum size is equal to its total racial Hit Dice in inches in depth and in 10 times its total racial HD feet in radius (minimum 1 inch and 10-foot radius). Once the cold creature ceases contact with it, the ice lasts for 1 round per racial Hit Die.<br />Creatures that are within the depth of the ice become trapped in it (no save). Trapped creatures take cold damage as if the cold creature had hit it (see Freezing Blows). Attempting to break free is a full-round action. A trapped creature must make a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 20 Escape Artist check to do so. The DC increases by 1 for every inch in depth of the ice greater than 1 inch. Against foes with the water subtype, the cold creature&rsquo;s freezing touch acts like freezing embrace (see above) but with no need for the cold creature to move over the target.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Skills: </strong>A cold creature has a +8 racial bonus to Stealth in cold environments. This increases to +12 in blizzards or other such bad weather in cold environments.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Qualities:</strong> A cold creature gains the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Cold Body (Ex):</em> A cold creature&rsquo;s body freezes all its touches or that touches it. Anyone striking a cold creature with natural or manufactured melee weapons takes 1d6 cold damage. If the base creature has a similar ability this ability replaces that one but the damage from the two abilities stack.</li>\n<li><em>Cold Walk (Ex): </em>A cold creature can walk over snow and ice without penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on snow or ice.

Its reach is 0 feet. A swarm does not threaten creatures in its square and cannot make attacks of opportunity with its swarm attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> A creature swarm gains the distraction universal monster ability and loses any special attacks that rely on the base creature&rsquo;s size, Strength, weapons, combat maneuver bonus, or reach.

A blood knight uses all of the base creature&rsquo;s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge Rating:</strong> As base creature +3.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Any evil.</p>\n<p><strong>Type:</strong> The creature&rsquo;s type changes to undead with the appropriate augmented subtype. Do not recalculate base attack bonuses, saves, or skill points.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> Change all current and future racial Hit Dice to d8s. As undead, blood knights use their Charisma modifier to determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution).</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Class:</strong> If the base creature has a natural armor bonus, it loses it and gains a deflection bonus equal to 3 + the base creature&rsquo;s original natural armor bonus.</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Abilities:</strong> The dread blood knight gains channel resistance +4, immunity to sonic effects, and SR equal to 12 + the dread blood knight&rsquo;s CR. Its DR increases to 15/bludgeoning.</p>\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> The dread blood knight&rsquo;s land speed increases by +10 feet over that of the base creature. If the base creature has no land speed, it gains a land speed of 40 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Attacks:</strong> The blood knight gains a primary slam attack if it has no other natural attacks. The damage for this slam attack depends on the base creature&rsquo;s size as if the base creature was one size category larger.</p>\n<p>All of a dread blood knight&rsquo;s natural attacks gain the grab universal monster ability and they deliver its blood drain special attack in addition to normal damage. All of a blood knight&rsquo;s piercing or slashing attacks, both natural and manufactured, gain the bleed (2d4 hp/round) universal monster ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> A blood knight retains all the base creature&rsquo;s special attacks and gains those described here. All DCs are Charisma-based unless otherwise specified:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Blood Drain (Ex):</em> Any living creature damaged by a blood knight&rsquo;s natural attack takes 1 point of Constitution damage in addition to the normal damage. This Constitution damage is subject to the multiplier for a critical hit, just as normal damage would be. In a grapple, a blood knight deals 2 points of Constitution damage (2d4 on a grapple). For each point of Constitution damage caused, the blood knight gains 5 temporary hit points.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><em>Blood Slick (Ex): </em>A blood knight constantly drips slippery blood in a 10-foot-radius spread around itself. Entering the area of a blood slick counts as difficult terrain and as it if were under the effects of a grease spell. The DC on the Reflex save to avoid falling is Charisma-based. Blood knights are immune to the slipperiness of any blood knight&rsquo;s blood slick.</li>\n<li><em>Fountain of Blood (Ex):</em> Once every 1d4 rounds, as a full-round action, a blood knight can spray blood from its armor in a great cascade. Each creature within a 30-foot radius is covered in blood and must succeed on a Fortitude save as though it had ingested the blood knight&rsquo;s poisonous blood. The blood fills the area until the blood knight&rsquo;s next turn. Creatures entering the spray while it persists are subject to its effects, but a creature can be affected only once per round.<br />The area covered by the blood spray becomes coated as though by a blood slick and remains slippery for 1 round per two Hit Dice the blood knight possesses. The blood remains until it is washed away with at least 5 gallons of water or other liquid, or burned away with normal or magical fire as a full-round action. Creatures and objects within the area that do not have total cover are coated with the blood, and a creature wishing to use, pick up, or cling to an item coated in the blood must succeed on a Reflex save (save DC is Charisma-based) to do so. Failure mean the item is immediately dropped. A creature coated in blood gains a +10 bonus on Escape Artist checks.<br />Blood knights are immune to the slipperiness of any blood knight&rsquo;s fountain of blood.</li>\n<li><em>Poison Blood (Ex):</em> Any opponent that strikes a blood knight with a bite attack is subject to this attack, as is any creature in the area of the fountain of blood attack.<br /><em>Poison Blood</em>&mdash;ingested;<em> save</em> Fortitude; <em>onset</em> 1 minute; <em>frequency</em> 1/minute for 6 minutes; <em>effect</em> 1 Con plus nauseated; <em>cure</em> 1 save. The save DC is Charisma-based.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Abilities:</strong> Str +6, Dex +6, Wis +2, Cha +8. As an undead creature, a dread blood knight has no Constitution score.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> A blood knight gains a +10 racial bonus on Escape Artist checks. It loses any racial bonuses to Stealth checks.</p>\n<p><strong>Feats:</strong> The dread blood knight gains Toughness as a bonus feat.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Qualities:</strong> A blood knight retains all the base creature&rsquo;s special qualities and gains those described here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Blood Body (Ex):</em> Because its body is entirely composed of blood, a blood knight can store items within its form. It can retrieve any item stored in its body as a move action or as a free action that is part of a move. An item to be stored must be of a size and shape that fits within whatever portion of the blood knight&rsquo;s armor it is placed. For example, an orc blood knight could store potion vials, crossbow quarrels, or daggers in its arm, but it could not store a longsword there. A stored item&rsquo;s weight counts towards a blood knight&rsquo;s encumbrance.</li>\n<li><em>Bonded Armor (Ex):</em> A blood knight always wears the suit of armor in which it died. It cannot remove this armor or exchange it for another suit. If the armor is destroyed, the blood knight is destroyed as well. The blood knight has a +5 bonus on saving throws made on behalf of its armor.</li>\n<li><em>Slithering Blood (Ex):</em> At will, a dread blood knight can leave its bonded armor as a slick pool of mobile blood. It can remain in this form for a number of minutes per day equal to its Charisma modifier (minimum 1). This time can be spread out over many different uses each day. <br />When in slithering blood form, the blood knight gains the immunities of the ooze type, has a movement speed equal to its land speed, gains a single slam attack that deals damage equal to a slam attack of its size.<br />The dread blood knight keeps all the abilities of a standard blood knight in slithering blood form with the exception of bonded armor, blood body, blood slick, fountain of blood and its AC bonus due to its armor. Its poison blood ability turns into a contact poison which affects anyone the dread blood knight hits with its slam attack or who contacts the knight with a natural attack or otherwise comes into contact with it. Additionally, in its slithering blood form, the dread blood knight gains the flow, pseudopodia, incredible compression and slick abilities of the slithering ooze template (see page 261). Any items it was carrying in its body via blood body are released into its armor as it oozes out.<br />If it is still in its slithering blood form after its allotted time per day is up a dread blood knight takes 1 Cha damage per minute as it starts boiling away. If it reaches 0 Cha the dread blood knight is destroyed.<br />If the dread blood knight&rsquo;s armor is destroyed while in blood ooze form it immediately loses half of its Charisma as ability damage. The dread blood knight starts loosing Cha at the rate of 1 per round unless it can find another appropriate kind of armor to inhabit. This armor becomes the blood knight&rsquo;s new bonded armor immediately upon inhabiting it.<br />Once back in its bonded armor the dread blood knight regains Charisma at the rate of 1 point per day.</li>\n<li>Creatures killed by Constitution damage from a blood knight&rsquo;s attacks rise as blood knights or blood gaunts in 1d4 rounds<span style=\"color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\">, depending on whether or not it was wearing heavy armor</span>.</li>\n</ul>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":""},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"0","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":""},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":[],"attackNotes":[],"soundEffect":"","changes":[{"_id":"yrz0tj1r","formula":"6","operator":"add","subTarget":"str","modifier":"racial","priority":0,"value":0},{"_id":"y43emd8m","formula":"6","operator":"add","subTarget":"dex","modifier":"racial","priority":0,"value":0},{"_id":"pbg29iw5","formula":"8","operator":"add","subTarget":"cha","modifier":"racial","priority":0,"value":0},{"_id":"nqkbit8y","formula":"10","operator":"add","subTarget":"skill.esc","modifier":"racial","priority":0,"value":0},{"_id":"y1inu9tx","formula":"2","operator":"add","subTarget":"wis","modifier":"racial","priority":0,"value":0}],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"scriptCalls":[],"featType":"template","associations":{"classes":[]},"showInQuickbar":false,"nonlethal":false,"abilityType":"none","crOffset":"3","disabled":false},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"y80nzxfncE91hA02":3,"WMadxIpIUgu0uAvn":3,"DH9noPYZRP1zLvEM":3,"wpj1hKUgB5eM1zCQ":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf1.monster-templates.Ovo97rjBymtgkjdH"}},"_id":"a31qt4CsAZOhAy7f"}

A dread allip uses all the base creature&rsquo;s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge Rating: </strong>Same as base creature +3.</p>\n<p><strong>Type:</strong> The creature&rsquo;s type changes to undead and gains the incorporeal subtype. Do not recalculate base attack bonuses, saves, or skill points.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Any evil.</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Class:</strong> A dread allip loses any armor or natural armor bonuses and gains a deflection bonus to Armor Class equal to its Charisma bonus (minimum +1). If the base creature already has a deflection bonus, use the higher value.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> Change all of the base creature&rsquo;s racial HD to d8s.</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Abilities:</strong> A dread allip retains all of the defensive abilities of the base creature save those that rely on a corporeal form to function. Dread allips gain channel resistance +4, the incorporeal ability, and all of the qualities and immunities granted by the undead type.</p>\n<p><strong>Speed: </strong>A dread allip loses all the base creature&rsquo;s speeds and gains a fly speed equal to the base creature&rsquo;s highest speed, with perfect maneuverability.</p>\n<p><strong>Attacks:</strong> All of the base creature&rsquo;s natural attacks become incorporeal touch attacks, retaining the same primary or secondary status they had for the base creature. The dread allip gains a primary incorporeal touch attack if it has no other natural attacks.</p>\n<p>The dread allip&rsquo;s natural attacks no longer deal normal damage. Instead, each attack deals Wisdom damage due to its Touch of Insanity ability (see below).</p>\n<p><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> The dread allip loses all special attacks that require corporeal contact, but gains those described here. A dread allip cannot cast spells that require material components unless it has the Eschew Materials feat.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Babble (Su):</em> A dread allip constantly mutters and whines to itself, creating a hypnotic effect. All sane creatures within 60 feet of the dread allip must succeed on a Will save or be affected as though by a hypnotism spell for 2d4 rounds. Any creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the same dread allip&rsquo;s babble for 24 hours.<br />When the dread allip casts a spell with a verbal component, its babble special attack is negated during casting, and any creature already hypnotized by it is freed of the effect. This is a sonic, mind- affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</li>\n<li><em>Command Allips (Su):</em> As a free action, a dread allip can automatically command all normal allips within 30 feet (as the command undead spell). Normal allips never attack a dread allip unless compelled.</li>\n<li><em>Create Spawn (Su): </em>A creature that dies while dominated by a dread allip rises as a new dread allip in 1d6 rounds if it committed suicide, or died fulfilling an obviously self-destructive command, or had 0 Wisdom and was within 30 feet of the dread allip at the time of death. Any creature that becomes a dread allip regains its normal Wisdom score immediately. The new dread allip is under the command (as though under the effect of a dominate monster spell) of the one that dominated it when it died.</li>\n<li><em>Dominating Trample (Su):</em> Once every 1d4 rounds, the dread allip may dominate creatures simply by passing through them. As a standard action during its turn, it can take a single move in a straight line. Any creature it moves through can attempt either an attack of opportunity or a Reflex save to avoid the attack. A creature that fails to avoid the dominating trample must succeed on a Will save or be controlled as if by the dominate monster spell (caster level 20th). Success renders a creature immune to that dread allip&rsquo;s dominating trample for 24 hours.<br />The dread allip can give the simple commands normal for the dominate monster spell (&ldquo;come here,&rdquo; &ldquo;go there,&rdquo; &ldquo;fight,&rdquo; &ldquo;stand still&rdquo;), plus &ldquo;commit suicide.&rdquo; The &ldquo;commit suicide&rdquo; command is an exception to the normal restrictions against self- destructive orders. A creature ordered to commit suicide receives a second saving throw at a +5 bonus to break free of the domination effect. Failure means the creature must attack itself once per round with the most damaging melee weapon or natural attack it possesses until ordered by the dread allip to do something else. Treat this attack as a coup de grace against a helpless target. The target can attempt a new save with the same +5 bonus every subsequent round that the domination continues. If the dread allip chooses to issue one of the other four commands available to it and obedience would obviously be self-destructive, the dominated creature gets a new saving throw to break free of the domination effect, again with a +5 bonus, when the self-destructive nature of the command becomes apparent.<br />This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</li>\n<li><em>Touch of Insanity (Su):</em> Each of a dread allip&rsquo;s incorporeal touch attacks deals 1d6 points of Wisdom damage (Will save negates). A successful critical hit causes 1d6 points of Wisdom damage and 1d4 points of Wisdom drain (instead of double Wisdom damage). A dread allip gains 5 temporary hit points for each point of Wisdom damage or drain. The save DC is Charisma-based.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Abilities:</strong> Dex +2, Cha +8. As an incorporeal undead creature, a dread allip has no Strength or Constitution score.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Qualities: </strong>The dread allip retains all the base creature&rsquo;s special qualities that do not require corporeal contact with another creature.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Madness (Su): </em>Any creature that targets a dread allip with a thought-detecting, mind-control, or telepathic effect takes 1d6 points of Wisdom damage (no save), though the effect otherwise works normally.</li>\n</ul>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":""},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"0","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":""},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":[],"attackNotes":[],"soundEffect":"","changes":[{"_id":"yxulg5xz","formula":"2","operator":"add","subTarget":"dex","modifier":"racial","priority":0,"value":0},{"_id":"2oo19ovq","formula":"8","operator":"add","subTarget":"cha","modifier":"racial","priority":0,"value":0}],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"scriptCalls":[],"featType":"template","associations":{"classes":[]},"showInQuickbar":false,"nonlethal":false,"abilityType":"none","crOffset":"3","disabled":false},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"y80nzxfncE91hA02":3,"WMadxIpIUgu0uAvn":3,"DH9noPYZRP1zLvEM":3,"wpj1hKUgB5eM1zCQ":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf1.monster-templates.Ovo97rjBymtgkjdH"}},"_id":"giSjsTWEQ3OEJMFu"}

Her teeth are fangs, and her hands clawed. Her limbs are contorted into long, skittering appendages.</em></p>\n<p>An aswang is an especially monstrous offshoot of a vampire. They resemble vampires in their true form&mdash;they are gaunt, gray and have claws and fangs&mdash;but are also capable of warping their bodies in a number of ways, taking the shape of people, or beasts, or various gargoyle-like horrors. No two aswangs thus ever look exactly alike, and they are often confused for other sorts of creatures. Aswangs have more catholic diets than many other vampires. In addition to blood, they also enjoy eating the organs of their victims, unborn children and rotting corpses.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An aswang can make more members of its horrible kind, but does not do so automatically as a vampire does. Instead, it requires a lengthy ritual more akin to the creation of a hag or lich. Some spiteful and cruel mortals become aswangs following a lengthy apprenticeship to an existing aswang, or an aswang may teach a manananggal or penanggalen the ritual to make them less dependent on a fragile mortal body.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Aswang&rdquo; is an acquired template that can be added to any living creature with 5 or more Hit Dice. Most aswangs were once humanoids, fey or monstrous humanoids.

Similarly, they recoil from strongly presented holy symbols and vials of coconut oil. &nbsp;These things don&rsquo;t harm the aswang&mdash;they merely keep it at bay. A recoiling aswang must stay at least 5 feet away from the coconut oil or holy symbol and cannot touch or make melee attacks against that creature. Holding an aswang at bay takes a standard action. After 1 round, an aswang can overcome its revulsion of the object and function normally each round it makes a DC 25 Will save.</p>\n<p>In order to destroy an incapacitated aswang, the creature must be quartered, and each half of its body, left and right, must be buried on opposite sides of a river or stream and both of the graves marked with a slashing or piercing weapon made of iron. If the aswang&rsquo;s body is not intact (say, through burning or a&nbsp;disintegrate&nbsp;spell), the ashes must be divided and buried in the same manner, after having been soaked in coconut oil.</p>\n<p>An aswang is not destroyed by sunlight, but cannot use its change shape or monstrous transformation abilities in sunlight.
